    "text": "Question 01\nIs it possible to predict a nation’s power consumption by considering its population size, gross domestic product (GDP), and the percentage of electricity generated from renewable sources and changes across the years?\n\nThe Importance of this Question\nPredicting a country’s power consumption is a difficult yet important taking on, necessary for guaranteeing sustained progress and energy stability. This subject explores the intricate relationship between economic progress, population growth, and sustainable energy consumption by examining a nation’s population size, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and the proportion of electricity generated from renewable sources. The research can provide valuable guidance for policy decisions, energy planning, and infrastructure investment to fulfill future energy demands in a sustainable manner.\n\n\nDependency Columns\nIn order to investigate this research issue, the following data columns are essential:\nPopulation (population) which functions as a surrogate for energy demand, as a larger population often necessitates greater energy consumption for residential, commercial, and industrial purposes.\nA larger Gross Domestic Product (gdp) frequently corresponds to an augmented consumption of energy as a result of industrialization, commercial endeavors, and improved living conditions.\nThe proportion of electricity generated by renewable sources, expressed as a percentage of total electricity generation, is represented by the variable renewable_energy / electricity_generation. Assessing the proportion of renewable energy in a nation’s entire electricity mix is vital for understanding its transition to sustainable energy sources and the effects on overall energy consumption patterns.\nEnergy Consumption (energy_consumption): Although this column may cover all forms of energy use, including electricity and more, it is essential for the study. If there is a particular column that contains data on electricity consumption, such as Energy Consumption it would be more directly applicable to the subject at hand.\nThe variable year is used to analysis time series.\n\n\nAnalysis plan\n\nData Cleaning:\n\nWe will Verify the dataset for any anomalies or missing values and address them appropriately using techniques like imputation or removal of incomplete records.\n\n\n\nFeature Engineering:\n\nWe will Calculate the percentage of electricity generated from renewable sources by dividing the renewable electricity consumption by the total electricity generation.\nStandardize or normalize the relevant columns if deemed beneficial for analysis.\n\n\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA):\n\nWe will Analyze and visualize the dataset to identify underlying patterns and relationships.\nExplore the distribution of variables like population size, GDP, renewable energy percentage, and energy consumption across different countries and years.\n\n\n\nDescriptive Statistics:\n\nWe will Generate statistical summaries for each dependence column to understand the distribution and central tendencies of the data.\nCalculate measures such as mean, median, standard deviation, and correlation coefficients.\n\nCorrelation Analysis:\n\nWe will Determine the magnitude and direction of the association between energy consumption and independent variables like population size, GDP, and renewable energy percentage using correlation analysis.\n\n\n\nTime Series Analysis:\n\nWe will Investigate trends, seasonality, and patterns over time for variables like energy consumption to understand past shifts and forecast future trends.\n\n\n\nRegression Analysis:\n\nWe will Utilize basic linear regression to comprehend the correlation between energy consumption and independent variables individually.\n\n\n\nMultiple Regression:\n\nwe will Apply multiple regression analysis to simultaneously consider multiple independent variables, such as population size, GDP, and renewable energy percentage, to predict energy usage more accurately.\n\n\n\n\nData Visualization\n\nLine Graphs:\nFor time series data, create graphs that illustrate the patterns of energy consumption, population growth, GDP, and the proportion of renewable energy over a period of time.\n\n\nScatterplots:\nAre used to visually represent the correlation between energy use and each of the independent variables. Heat-maps are a useful tool for visualizing the correlation matrix, as they effectively emphasize the strength of correlations between variables.\n\n\nBar and pie charts:\nAre used to visually represent the breakdown of energy sources, with a specific emphasis on differentiating between renewable and non-renewable energy. We are not decided yet that which techniques will be used here.\n\n\nModel Evaluation:\nEvaluate the models by employing suitable metrics such as R-squared and RMSE for regression analysis to assess their performance and accuracy in predicting energy consumption."

    "text": "Question 02\nWhat countries or regions are engaging in sustainable energy practices and relying more on renewable energy compared to nonrenewable energy? Which countries are moving towards the trajectory of relying more on renewable energy and producing less greenhouse gas emissions?\n\nThe Importance of this Question:\nThe goal of this question is to analyze the energy practices of various countries and determine which countries are practicing sustainable energy and reducing the energy consumption of nonrenewable energy sources. Sustainable energy. This question seeks to determine which countries rely more on non-renewable energy sources compared to that of renewable energy sources. An analysis will also be done to determine which countries based on the current information is moving in the trajectory of using renewable energy sources using regression analysis. For this data the countries will be divided into countries with larger and smaller populations to handle any form of bias that may occur due to the population sizes of the various countries. A log transformation can also be done to the population to resolve this issue.\n\n\nDependency Columns:\nTo complete the analysis of this question, the following data columns are essential.\n\nPopulation:\nThis functions as a surrogate for energy demand as a larger population often necessitates a greater energy consumption for residential commercial and industrial purposes.\n\n\nEnergy consumed:\nThese columns pertaining to the total amount of energy comsumed for each country will be assessed for the purpose of this analysis to determine the proportion of sustainable electrical energy sources from the total electricity consumption.\n\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions:\nThis will determine which regions or countries produce the most green house gases and cause pollution.\n\n\nRenewable and non-renewable consumption:\nThe renewable and non renewable consumption columns and all other related columns will be used to determine the countries engaging in sustainable energy practices.\n\n\n\nAnalysis plan\n\nData Preparation and Analysis\n\nWe have missing values in our dataset. Here, we will employ advanced machine learning imputation techniques like iterative imputation to obtain a reliable dataset. Then, we will check for skewness in important columns like population, GDP, energy consumed, renewable, and non-renewable consumption.\n\n\n\nFeature Engineering\nThis step involves calculating the proportions of renewable and non-renewable energy sources relative to total energy consumption.\n\nCalculate proportion of renewable energy: \\[\n\\frac{{\\text{{Solar consumption}} + \\text{{Wind consumption}}}}{{\\text{{Total energy consumption}}}}\n\\]\nCalculate proportion of non-renewable energy:\\[\n\\frac{{\\text{{Biofuel consumption}}}}{{\\text{{Total energy consumption}}}}\n\\]\n\nThese metrics reveal the usage of renewable and non-renewable energy relative to total consumption.\n\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA):\n\nWe will Analyze the distribution of renewable and non-renewable energy consumption across countries using histograms.\nVisualize trends in renewable energy adoption over time using line plots.\nInvestigate correlations between GDP and renewable energy usage through scatter plots.\nExamine the relationship between population size and greenhouse gas emissions using scatter plots.\n\nThis phase involves analyzing and visualizing the dataset to discern patterns and relationships, providing valuable insights into sustainable energy practices and the transition towards renewable energy sources.\n\n\nDescriptive Statistics:\n\nWe will Generate a statistical summary for each of the dependence columns, such as renewable energy consumption and non-renewable energy consumption, to ascertain their magnitude and association. This involves calculating measures such as mean, median, standard deviation, and correlation coefficients between these variables.\n\n\n\nRegression Analysis:\n\nWe will utilize regression analysis with predictors such as renewable energy consumption, GDP, population size, and greenhouse gas emissions to identify countries maximizing sustainable energy practices. This analysis aims to determine the relationship between these variables and sustainable energy practices, providing insights for effective policy-making and intervention strategies.\n\n\n\nData Visualization\nMaps: The use of maps will be employed to visualize the hotspots of countries which utilize renewable energy the most and those that focus on non-renewable energy sources. If external data is needed, we will incorporate it as well.\nLine graphs: Line graphs will be used to determine the patterns in the use of certain renewable and non-renewable energy sources over the years for certain regions.\nDensity plots: Density plots will be used to visualize the distribution of data for renewable and non-renewable energy sources across continents and or other forms of regional boundaries."
