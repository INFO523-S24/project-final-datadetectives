## Abstract

This project utilizes the comprehensive energy dataset from Our World in Data, spanning from 1900 to 2022, to examine the global energy consumption trends regarding economic growth, population dynamics, and the adoption of sustainable energy practices. The primary goal of the project is to design a predictive dashboard that models a nation’s energy consumption based on essential factors such as population size, GDP, and the proportion of electricity derived from renewable sources. The analysis will utilize a range of statistical and machine learning techniques, including time series decomposition, linear regression for key predictors, and regression analysis. We will evaluate the performance of these regression models using R-squared and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metrics to gauge their accuracy and explanatory power. This evaluation is essential for enhancing predictive accuracy and reliability in energy policy formulation and planning. The project will analyze trends in the use of renewable energy at the regional and national levels, with a certain emphasis on emphasizing countries that lead the way in sustainable energy practices and those making progress toward lower greenhouse gas emissions. This analysis will provide crucial insights for industry and researchers dedicated to promoting energy sustainability and promoting economic growth.

Question 1

Is it possible to predict a nation's power consumption by considering its population size, gross domestic product (GDP), and the percentage of electricity generated from renewable sources and changes across the years?

                        'primary_energy_consumption',

    A right-skewed distribution is shown by the distribution's shape, which shows that most values are low and that frequency drops off quickly as values rise. In order to train the model to identify patterns and to validate its correctness by contrasting the projected values with the actual data shown in the plot, the historical data represented in this histogram would be crucial.

    axes[i].set_yticklabels([])  

# Adding a common y-axis label on the left side of the subplots

    The relationship between primary energy consumption and the GDP, population size, and the proportion of power derived from renewable sources is represented graphically in this plot. If persistent patterns are seen over time, one might utilize the spread and trends of the scatter points to deduce that there might be correlations between these parameters and a country's power consumption, which could be used to anticipate energy usage.

    Indicating possible relationships between these variables and a country's power consumption, the graphic shows how the population, GDP, percentage of renewable electricity, and energy consumption have changed over time. For example, if GDP and population growth are accompanied by an upward trend in the primary energy consumption curve, this could indicate that energy demand is driven by economic activity and demographic growth. On the other hand, while a rise in the proportion of power derived from renewable sources may not necessarily translate into reduced energy usage, it may suggest a change in the composition of energy sources. Time periods in which the growth of energy consumption slows down or deviates from trends in GDP and population may be linked to advancements in energy efficiency or structural adjustments in the economy. examining these patterns and connections across time. In order to forecast future power consumption patterns, data demonstrating a high historical association between these variables can be used to develop a predictive model through the analysis of such trends and relationships across time.

# Question 2

What countries or regions are engaging in sustainable energy practices and relying more on renewable energy compared to nonrenewable energy? Which countries are moving towards the trajectory of relying more on renewable energy and producing less greenhouse gas emissions?

The density plots for the consumption of renewable energy represent the distribution of renewable energy consumption over the years from 1965 to the year 2022. It shows the distribution of energy consumption for the seven continents and how the distribution of this type of energy consumption changes with time. From the y axis, we notice that not much of renewable is consumed especially when we view this in relation to the density plot on non renewable energy consumption which shows large amounts of energy being consumed. The world has recently been focusing on a shift from the consumption of more of non-renewable energy to renewable energy as a form of sustainable energy practices. From the animated density plot, we can see that over the years more and more of renewable energy is being consumed as the times progress. The major continents that have increased their consumption of renewable energy over time are Europe, Asia, and North America. The 3 continents have increased their consumption of non-renewable energy over time compared to the others. Consumption of renewable energy increased from 100s to 1000s of energy being consumed on a yearly basis. This is a good sign that most of these continents are beginning to exploit the use of renewable energy as recommended under sustainable energy practices.

### Non-renewables consumption Plot

The visualization for the non-renewable consumption of energy

```{python}
#| label: density2_redone

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Convert the animation to HTML format

There has also been an increase in the consumption of non-renewable energy consumption across the continents over the years. This could be attributed to an increase in population and others. Under sustainable energy practices, it is recommended to have more reliance on renewable than non-renewable energy sources such that the future generation will also have some of the non-renewable energy sources left to use. The continents that saw major increases in the use of non-renewable energy over the years are the very same continents that were the major consumers of renewable energy, that is Europe, Asia, and North America.

The results from this analysis reveals that the increase in renewable energy consumption is also matched by an increase in the consumption of non renewable energy. Overtime, we hope that the consumption of renewable energy will surpass that of renewable energy as recommended under sustainable energy practices.

## Cluster

Here, the patterns in the data are identified to help form clusters in the data based on the consumption of renewable and non-renewable energy. The goal here. is to predict which class a country or regional boundary may belong to in relation to their of renewable and non-renewable energy to determine which of these countries and or regional boundaries are taking their energy consumption more in the direction of renewable energy consumption as is required by the sustainable energy practices.

The required packages for the cluster analysis are imported.

```{python}
#| label: setup


import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
import scipy.stats as stats
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from sklearn.metrics import calinski_harabasz_score
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from scipy.cluster import hierarchy
from scipy.spatial.distance import pdist
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN
from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score
from sklearn.metrics import adjusted_rand_score
from matplotlib.patches import Ellipse
```

The data is dealt with appropriately for missing values and duplicates. The numerical features in the data set are also standardized and categorical variables encoded. For this analysis.

```{python}
#| label: wrangling_clusters

energy = pd.read_csv('data/owid-energy-data.csv')
energy_copy = energy.copy()

### to handle missing values we first replace all NA values with the number 0
energy_copy = energy_copy.fillna(0)
### now we remove all rows with only 0 values with the exception of the major rows
# Select columns to check for 0 values
columns_to_check = energy_copy.columns.difference(['year', 'iso_code', 'country', 'population', 'gdp'])
# Filter rows with 0 values in all columns except 'year', 'country', and 'iso_code'
energy_copy = energy_copy[(energy_copy[columns_to_check] != 0).any(axis = 1)]
# Check for duplicate rows
duplicate_rows = energy[energy.duplicated()]
#### creating new columns in the energy data set
### creating new columns in the energy dataset for the renewable and non renewable energy consumption
### creating a column for the total consumption of non-renewable energy
energy_copy['non_renewables_consumption'] = energy_copy['coal_consumption'] + energy_copy['fossil_fuel_consumption'] + energy_copy['gas_consumption'] +  energy_copy['nuclear_consumption'] + energy_copy['oil_consumption']
### a new column for the total consumption is created 
energy_copy['total_consumption'] = energy_copy['non_renewables_consumption'] + energy_copy['renewables_consumption']
##### selecting the numerical columns in the data set
numerical_cols = energy.select_dtypes(include = 'number').columns
### scaling the numerical columns in the data set
minmax_scaler = MinMaxScaler()
energy_copy[numerical_cols] = minmax_scaler.fit_transform(energy_copy[numerical_cols])
# Encoding the categorical variables
categorical_columns = energy_copy.select_dtypes(include = ['object', 'category']).columns.tolist()
energy_copy[categorical_columns] = energy_copy[categorical_columns].astype(str)
# looping through the categorical variables to encode them
label_encoders = {columns: LabelEncoder() for columns in categorical_columns}
for columns in categorical_columns:
    energy_copy[columns] = label_encoders[columns].fit_transform(energy_copy[columns])
### selecting the relevant columns for this analysis.
energy_features = energy_copy[['year','country','iso_code',  'renewables_consumption', 'non_renewables_consumption', 'total_consumption', 'carbon_intensity_elec','electricity_generation']]



```

#### Selecting the Features for clustering

The necessary features required for developing the clusters in the data set for renewable and non-renewable energy consumption are selected.

The data set is scaled and encoded for the purpose of this analysis to ensure accurate results are derived from this analysis. 

A K means clustering is performed on the features of the data set to divide the data set into clusters. This method of clustering is chosen because of simplicity, speed and efficiency.

The Calinksi-Harabasz method is used here to determine the optimal number of clusters for this analysis.

```{python}
#| label: calinski
#| warning: false

#### determining the optimal number of clusters using the Calinki-Harabsz method
### initializing the lists to store scores 

ch_scores = []
for n_clusters in range(2, 11):
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=n_clusters, random_state=42)
    kmeans.fit(energy_features)
    ch_score = calinski_harabasz_score(energy_features, kmeans.labels_)
    ch_scores.append(ch_score)
```

A visualization is provided below to help determine what the appropriate number of clusters should be based on this method.

```{python}
#| label: calinski_plot

### creating the plot for the ch scores 
plt.figure(figsize = (10, 6))
sns.lineplot(x = range(2, 11), y = ch_scores, marker = 'o')
plt.xlabel('Number of Clusters (K)')
plt.ylabel('Calinski-Harabasz Score')
plt.title('Calinski-Harabasz Score vs. Number of Clusters')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

From this visualization 8 is the optimal number of clusters for this analysis. Using the optimal number of clusters from the Calinski method of cluster selection, the k means clustering is performed.

```{python}
#| label: k_means

#### using the k means algorithm
k = 8
### performing the k means clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters = k, random_state = 12)
clusters = kmeans.fit_predict(energy_features)
energy_copy['cluster'] = clusters
```

The results from the k means cluster algorithm are visualized below.

```{python}
#| label: k_means_plot

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.scatterplot(x='renewables_consumption', y = 'non_renewables_consumption', hue = 'cluster', data = energy_copy, palette = 'Set1', legend = 'full')
plt.xlabel('Renewables Consumption')
plt.ylabel('Non-Renewables Consumption')
plt.title('K-Means Clustering of Energy Consumption')
plt.legend(title='Cluster')
plt.show()
```

A DBSCAN is performed to ensure refine the clusters and ensure that these clusters are well separated by outliers.

This is done by first calculating the distance to the nearest neighbour and then visualizing the plot.

```{python}
#| label: nearest_neighbor


## calculating the average distance to the closest neighbor
#### the number of neighbors taken into consideration for this analysis is 5
neighbors = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors = 5)
neighbors_fit = neighbors.fit(energy_features)
distances, indices = neighbors_fit.kneighbors(energy_features)
avg_distances = np.mean(distances[:, 1:], axis = 1)

## sorting the average distances
avg_distances_sorted = np.sort(avg_distances)
```

The minimum number of samples are chosen and the DBSCAN is performed to determine if there are any outliers in the clusters and the clusters are refined for more accuracy.

```{python}
#| label: minval&eps
### setting the min_samples parameter 
eps = 17500
### the number 5 is selected for this analysis
min_samples = 5
### initializing the dbscan with the chosen parameters
dbscan = DBSCAN(eps = eps, min_samples = min_samples)
## fitting the DBSCAN to the features of the energy data set
clusters = dbscan.fit_predict(energy_features)
```

```{python}
#| label: dbscan_viz

### visualizing the clusters
plt.figure(figsize = (10, 6))
sns.scatterplot(x = 'renewables_consumption', y='non_renewables_consumption', hue = clusters, data = energy_copy, palette = 'viridis')
plt.title('DBSCAN Clustering')
plt.xlabel('Renewables Consumption')
plt.ylabel('Non-Renewables Consumption')
plt.legend(title = 'Clusters')
plt.show()
```

The number of outliers are also calculated after the dscan is performed.

```{python}
#| label: outliers

outliers = energy_features[clusters == -1]  
num_outliers = len(outliers)
print(f'Number of outliers detected: {num_outliers}')
```

The silhouette scores for this analysis is found as a form of cluster validation of this analysis.

```{python}
#| label: sillhouette_score

silhouette_avg = silhouette_score(energy_features, clusters)
rounded_score = round(silhouette_avg, 2)
print("Silhouette Score:", rounded_score)
```

The silhouette score of 0.96 implies that the clustering here is a good one. it means that the data points are well clustered and are closer to the center of their respective clusters compared to other clusters. This indicates that there is a clear separation between clusters with good cohesion within clusters.
