# Introduction

### Why we are choosing this data-set?

### Idea of Analysis

# Question 01:

**Is it possible to predict a nation's power consumption by considering its population size, gross domestic product (GDP), and the percentage of electricity generated from renewable sources and changes across the years?**

### The Importance of this Question:

Predicting a country's power consumption is a difficult yet important taking on, necessary for guaranteeing sustained progress and energy stability. This subject explores the intricate relationship between economic progress, population growth, and sustainable energy consumption by examining a nation's population size, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and the proportion of electricity generated from renewable sources. The research can provide valuable guidance for policy decisions, energy planning, and infrastructure investment to fulfill future energy demands in a sustainable manner.

### Dependency Columns:

In order to investigate this research issue, the following data columns are essential: Population (population) which functions as a surrogate for energy demand, as a larger population often necessitates greater energy consumption for residential, commercial, and industrial purposes. A larger Gross Domestic Product (`gdp`) frequently corresponds to an augmented consumption of energy as a result of industrialization, commercial endeavors, and improved living conditions. The proportion of electricity generated by renewable sources, expressed as a percentage of total electricity generation, is represented by the variable "`renewables_electricity` / `electricity_generation`". Assessing the proportion of renewable energy in a nation's entire electricity mix is vital for understanding its transition to sustainable energy sources and the effects on overall energy consumption patterns. Energy Consumption (`energy_consumption`): Although this column may cover all forms of energy use, including electricity and more, it is essential for the study. If there is a particular column that contains data on electricity consumption, such as "`electricity_consumption`" it would be more directly applicable to the subject at hand. The variable `years` is used to analysis time series.

### Analysis plan:

**Data Preparation and Analysis:** ***`Data Cleaning:`*** helps to verify that the data is devoid of anomalies and to address any missing or incorrect values in a suitable manner. Feature Engineering: To get the percentage of electricity generated from renewable sources, divide the value of r`enewables_electricity` by the value of `electricity_generation`. If we find it to be beneficial, we can standardize or normalize the appropriate columns. ***`Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):`*** is a process of analyzing and visualizing data to gain insights and understand the underlying patterns and relationships in the data. Descriptive Statistics: Generate a statistical summary for each of the dependence columns in order to gain insight into the distribution of the data. Correlation Analysis: aims to ascertain the magnitude and orientation of the association between the dependent variable (`energy_consumption`) and independent variables. ***`Time series analysis :`*** For time-series data, examine trends, seasonality, and patterns over time for each variable, particularly energy consumption, to comprehend past shifts and forecast future trends. ***`Regression analysis:`*** Begin by employing a basic linear regression model to comprehend the correlation between energy use and the independent variables. Multiple Regression: Apply multiple regression analysis to consider multiple independent variables concurrently, comprehending their combined influence on energy usage.

\
**Data Visualization:** For time series data, create graphs that illustrate the patterns of energy consumption, population growth, GDP, and the proportion of renewable energy over a period of time. ***`Scatter plots:`*** are used to visually represent the correlation between energy use and each of the independent variables. Heat-maps are a useful tool for visualizing the correlation matrix, as they effectively emphasize the strength of correlations between variables. ***`Bar charts and pie charts:`*** are used to visually represent the breakdown of energy sources, with a specific emphasis on differentiating between renewable and non-renewable energy. We are not decided yet that which techniques will be used here.

**Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the models by employing suitable metrics such as R-squared and RMSE for regression analysis to assess their performance and accuracy in predicting energy consumption.
